# Final Biometry Class 12-8-2020

Coding Final
- Due Dec 15
- Can use all resources except each other

Dec 15 Written Final 
- Have 2 hours to complete, but shouldn't take 2 hours
- Casey and Cam will be online, but don't need to be on zoom unless we have a question
- Cumulative but weighted for most recent
- questions like "do you know theh difference between these ANOVA's"

PCA
- check assumptions: normality and homoescedasticity
- no collinearity by default
- can do a perMANOVA
- can do a multiple regression

Casey's office hours at 11 tomorrow
Will put the key for PS8 on canvas for reference this week

anova model
- colon for interaction
- slash for nesting
  - ex. B nested within A is "A/B"

Moving forward at the end
- make a cheat sheet for stats 
- make a road map for myself so I don't forget down the line
- in future, I can look at my cheat sheet and say "based on the kind of data I have or want to collect, here's the kind of test I can/should do"
- create a sort of dichotomous key

Beware of the limits of p values.
- p values don't tell you if something is right or wrong. they tell us the probability of whether something is right or wrong.
