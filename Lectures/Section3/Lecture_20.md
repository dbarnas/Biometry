### More on PCA

**Example Biplot**
- colors are different species of algae
- Traits measured are listed for each species
- horizontal (or near horizontal) loadings are most associated with PC1 and vertical (or near vertical) loadings are most associated with PC2
- Fv correlated really well with PC1 so PC1 is definitely fluorescence, and maybe a little bit quantum yield and a little bit Ln Cell Count
  - so the horizontal dispersion on the PCA is driven mainly by Fluorescence
- loadings that are close to each other are the most correlated to each other
- small loadings (tiny nubby arrows) may not correlate well to PC1 or PC2 but correlates strongly to PC3
- blue species have relaly high quantum yield and purple have really low quantum yield
  - arrows show positive correlation, but if you were to flip the arrow in the other direction, that shows you the negative correlation
- the direction of the loadings indicates correlation to the PC. So Fv is negatively correlated to PC1 (so as PC1 goes up, Fv goes down, but that doesn't matter for biological interpretation.)
- scaling:
  - whether you scale or not depends on how the graph should look
  - so if you want your graph to be a square, you may need to scale to fit it all, but it wouldn't be as obvious if groups are actually farther from each other than the graph shows.
- If two axes are both realtively important (PC1 doesn't explain way more variation than PC2), then you'll get a square plot anyway
